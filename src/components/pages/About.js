        Hi there! My name is Sam Mulcahy and this is my portfolio's landing
        page. I am currently a student and Columbia University's Full Stack
        Development bootcamp. I have a bachelors in Theatre and I still think of
        almost everything in terms of art. I enjoy cooking, noise-rock, foreign
        films, and photography. In fact, all photographs that you see on
        this page were taken by me! Please browse what I've created. If you
        click on the preview image for a project, it will take you to a deployed
        version. If you'd like to contact me you'll find my information at the
        bottom of the page. Thank you for visiting my portfolio, I hope you have
        a wonderful day.
